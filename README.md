# AnimalSpotted
The purpose of this project is to simulate trials until a particular animal is spotted by writing a text file(s). 

We use for loops and if statements to ensure the user's input is correct/setting the number of trials. 

This project allows you to write a text file as well as use concepts

<+s>: This program helped me gain the confidence to attempt the challenge program.

I am glad I attempted those program as it was challenging and will help me for future programs.
